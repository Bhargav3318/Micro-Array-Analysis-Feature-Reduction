In Microarray Data Analysis, machine learning has experienced a groundbreaking evolution, yet
faced exceptional obstructions due to the complex nature/dimensions of the data. This research
paper is focused on attribute reduction, a critical pre-processing stage, this publication investigates
the microarray analysis sector. The study discloses the use of the Fuzzy Discernibility Matrix
and Fuzzy-Rough Sets to overcome the problems of dimensional reduction. Furthermore, Hybrid
Decision Systems are examined as a means of augmenting classification accuracy in microarray
data. This analysis looks at how to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of machine learning models
in the domain of microarray data analysis. One technique examined for handling the scalability
challenges common to high-dimensional datasets is MapReduce, a framework for parallel processing.
Ultimately, this research adds to the knowledge base on these approaches and their potential for
improving analysis outcomes.
